Math operations in java

 If you are given a number and 4 other numbers, can you design a program that gives the exact operations required to achieve the result. 

For example, 16 and (1,3,4,5) could produce as a result : 3 * 4 + 5 - 1 

Only consider the operators : + - * and () 

The divide is NOT to be considered.

(Easier option : + - and * only, process elements left to right without taking care of the priority of operations).
